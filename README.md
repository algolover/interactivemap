# InteractiveMap
Interactive map based visualization of temporal geospatial data i.e. for data that is spread out across time and space.
In this project, I've used AFCON(African Cup of Nations) Data from 2002 to 2010. I've used lesser data because my focus 
was on adding more features and making intuitive UI & UX, thus providing better User Experience.

# Features:

1. All the participating nations for the particular edition are Highlighted.
2. Winning nation is also highlighted using a Trophy Icon that helps in identifying the winner amongst the participants spontaneously.
3. Information about Host Nation, Stadiums Used is also provided according to the Edition of the tournament in the sidebar.
4. All links are clickable and takes user to different sites where they can read more about the countries, stadiums and watch youtube
videos. Also, all links are opened in a new tab, thus preventing the user from being redirected from the site accidentally.
5. Popup is shown when user clicks on a participating nation. Details about the nation is shown.
6. Users are also allowed to add interesting facts. The facts are also displayed in the sidebar.
7. Reset Button is provided when user zoom in from the default zoom level.
8. Minimum and Maximum Zoom are also pre-defined along with the default initial co-ordinates.
9. A Slider is provided to move between different editions of the tournament and see the related data.
10. Highlights of the tournament is also provided for users to watch through link in the sidebar.



# Special attention on UI and UX
1. Map is centred such that African Continent is displayed nicely at an optimal zoom level when site is opened.
2. Trophy icon to depict the winner thus providing better Accessibility.
3. Reset button is made Red indicating that the changes are irreversible and fades out slowly when zoom value is below the threshold level.
4. Color of the 'Add Fact' button also indicating that some change will be made to the website.
5. Many other small signifiers are also added to improve the overall User Experience.

As this is a dummy project, not much attention was being paid to the security aspect except for add comment section where character limit is set.
